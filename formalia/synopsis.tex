Schedules operating in inaccessible areas such as space where it is uncommon to have direct communication with the nanosatellite throughout its orbit. Errors occurring during these phases can have major implications on the nanosatellite, if not handled correctly. This project aims to develop a tool, easing the process of making schedules as well as reducing the chance of human errors. This is achieved with the use of \acrshort{cora} and \acrshort{smc} tools, along with a custom script that transforms \acrshort{cora} and \acrshort{smc} data into the final schedule along with statistical data for the schedule.\\

The development for this tool being with a short analysis of previous work done within this area of scheduling nanosatellites leading to potential improvement being described along with a purposed solution, which is solved by modelling the problem in \acrshort{cora}, in conjunction with the custom script an optimal schedule is produced. This is then fed to our developed \acrshort{smc} model to perform robustness checks, to verify the schedules stability.
