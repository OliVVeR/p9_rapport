Scheduling in orbit can be a daunting task where many factors needs to be considered, this rapport aims to accommodate GomX in generation schedules for their nanosatellites. GomX could benefit from having partial or fully generated schedules, and this rapport will go over how this could be achieved. GomX has a desired to alleviate the time required to create a schedule, this has increased over the years since the amount of launched nanosatellites has gone up. This trend has made it impractically to continue generating schedules by hands.

%Finding an optimal schedule requires the machine to traverse a lot of paths to find the optimal solution, this often extensive use of memory and CPU.
