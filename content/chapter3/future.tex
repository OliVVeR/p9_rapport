\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future}

\subsection{Memory Considerations}
Payloads produce data that needs to be stored

\subsection{Start Orbit Time}
Just like the start SOC in the INI file

\subsection{The moon is in our way}
less energy gained per insolation

\subsection{A followed by B}
After running one L-band job we must run two X-band before running another L

\subsection{Satellite facing}
does the satellite face earth of other

\subsection{Internal Storage}
How can storage impact the schedule generation

\subsection{Battery Decay}

\subsection{Schedule Shipping}
%4.3 Schedule Shipping
%In order to uplink a schedule to GomXâ€“3, several comma separated files (.csv)
%are generated. Each file contains a list of job opportunities of a certain type,
%for example L-Band (see below), given by two timestamps representing the start
%time and the end time of the job window respectively, the implied duration of
%the timestamps, as well as a flag that shows whether the opportunity should be
%taken.
