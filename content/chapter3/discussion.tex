\chapter{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
In this chapter we will discuss aspects of this project which could have been done differently whether it being a result of making a decision to exclude something, choosing one approach over another, or simplifications made to better the execution time of the system.

\subsection*{Iterative Adjustment of the Nanosatellite Configuration} \label{subsec:disc_itt}
Iterative adjustment of the nanosatellite configuration was never implemented, as we estimated that it was not possible to make a correct and non naive implementation within the time frame of this project.
The downside of not having this is that the user manually has to adjust their configuration and it may be difficult to decide which parts of the input that have to be tuned, as it can be difficult to identify what changes will have a noticeable impact. \\
The user is also limited in what they are able to change, as it is not possible to modify all of the internal variables, and some values should never be changed. Some are hidden anyway to lower the required knowledge of the internal tools, \gls{cora} and \gls{smc}, in order to make the system easier to use. 
%Instead of having to manually adjust the configuration, it could be possible to make the system self configurable at the end of an iteration. Either to explorer new schedules or a more aggressive robustness analysis. For example, \cref{fig:tool_act}  have added an additional step to the tool-chain by allowing the system to loop if the robustness queries were unsatisfied. The system would then have to adjust the variables, such as the [min, max]

Since the iterative adjustment of the nanosatellite configuration have become manual, we have supplied an updated version of the tool-chain which now handles a "No" and "Yes" equally in location 6.

\subsection*{Battery Wear and Lifetime} \label{subsec:disc_life}
We did not implement any major features that would try to avoid straining the battery. 
But as Wognsen et al. 2015\cite{score_function} expresses, it is important to predict the battery wear for battery powered systems as it is a central part of predicting the system's lifetime.
Wognsen et al. 2015\cite{score_function} presented a scoring function to compare and evaluate the impact of battery usage profiles on cycle life. Their scoring system would have been simple to implement as the \gls{cora} model is always aware of the battery's \gls{soc}. However, the authors conclude that the score does not indicate to what effect the usage profile will have on the battery life. They do note that it is expected that with a large enough amount of experiments, it would be possible to tailor the function to a specific battery type, such as the one the GomX-3 nanosatellite is equipped with. \\
It is difficult to use the scoring system without knowing what the scores represent in actual wear, as it makes it hard to determine how significant getting a high score is compared to a low one. However, as we have a large focus on battery in this project, it would have been sensible to include battery ware

%We are currently not able to model that the battery deteriorate over time, but since the user can theoretically calculate the actual capacity of the battery and set the maximum capacity to that value, it is possible to pass the information to the model.
%However, a location have been added to the UPPAAL \gls{smc} model in order to avoid overcharging the battery, as explained in \myref{sec:smc_model}.\\
%We believe that since our tool has an emphasis on battery usage, the ability to model battery wear and avoid schedules that have a high impact on it, will be sensible to implement. 

\subsection*{Improving Insolation}
As seen in \cref{fig:cora_inso} in \myref{sec:cora} the initial location for the Insolation template is \uppVar{inSun}. This should be changed to allow schedules to start in the other location \uppVar{inEclipse}. Similar our clocks used in the template is always initially zero, this will create a problem for the user if they want to start their schedule at another time in the orbit. A solution could be to introduce a new initial committed location that has edges to \uppVar{inSun} and \uppVar{inEclipse}. On each of the new edges a guard will need to be placed, this should check the user defined value to indicate which starting location it should transition to. Additionally on both edges there should be an update, to set the clock to the correct time according to what the user has specified in the configuration specifications.

\subsection*{Zero Windows}
As of now the models, both \gls{cora} and \gls{smc}, does not support there being no defined windows in the payload description as several variables are dependant on this. However, as windows is an important concept for our context we do not believe this to be a problem, as at least one window will most likely always be defined. Also there is a workaround by defining all payloads as being dependant on the window $0-OrbitTime$, meaning that they are not restricted by the window.

\subsection*{Battery Importance}
During our meeting with Lars Alminde from GomSpace we discussed our approach as well as potential new approaches. He expressed that nanosatellites battery was not as important as initially assumed\cite{gom_space_conversation}. This may be a combination of multiple factors like increased battery capacity and more efficient solar panels. Given that our meeting with GomSpace was late in the project we decided to keep battery as an aspect of our problem statement.
