\subsection{looping schedules}
problem determine SOC when a battery ends 

logic or in dependencies

Battery Decay

\subsection{SMC flaw}
scheduler predict cost of the next payload based on a and b? but dose not take recharge into account or the waiting period of the payload has executed, so potentially it is possible for the battery to go under the threshold if the waiting period after the payload and the next one is enough to have idle energy cost make the battery go under the threshold,
