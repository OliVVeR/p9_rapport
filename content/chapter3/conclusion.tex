\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this section we conclude on the report and project to evaluate on the degree of which we fulfilled the problems discovered during \nameref{cha:problem} \cref{cha:problem} accumulating in the problem statement:

\enquote{How is it possible to produce a schedule that consider multiple requirements, and how is it possible to verify the robustness of such a schedule}

We successfully made a project which is capable of producing a schedule upholding the set of requirements though our \gls{cora} model using the provided information about payloads and global properties. Furthermore we were able to check the robustness of the produced schedule utilising the \gls{smc} model to final output statistics about the schedule performance. All of this is bundle into a complete solution to minimize or eliminate any knowledge of the tools used in our solution.
