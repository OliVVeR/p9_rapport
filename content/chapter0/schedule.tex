\section{Schedule} \label{sec:schedule}
A schedule is a set of instructions of when each payload is suppose to start and end, furthermore we define a valid schedule to obey the following criteria (i) payloads should only be executed when dependencies are uphold (ii) payloads with windows should only be executed during their windows (iii) the battery levels may not go below the specified threshold at any point during the entire schedule.

We want to discuss the type of real-time the schedule is in, as it will affect how we should design our model.
Three categories exist within real-time systems, hard, firm, and soft. Hard defines that if a payload exceed its deadline it will have catastrophic consequences on the system or it may enter a fail state. A firm system have no critical consequence if a deadline is missed, but the data gathered by the payload will be of no value if it exceeds its deadline. Lastly soft describes a system where the value of the results are diminish when deadlines are missed\cite{real_time_computing}.

We can contextualise these types of real time by examining what would happen if the nanosatellite start a data gathering payload, which it then has to abort because it exceeds its deadline.
The hard case does not accurately describe what would happen, as it is not critical that the payload is completed. The nanosatellite would still continue to operate even if the payload was interrupted. Even the payloads that are responsible for receiving new schedules are not critical as the nanosatellite would still be functional. It is however very unfortunate if it does not receive a new schedule, as no work can be done until a new one is received.\\
As mentioned earlier in \nameref{sec:gomx3} \ref{sec:gomx3}, when a data collection payload is started, it must also finish within the window, as payloads that are aborted early or started late are not considered interesting. We do not believe that soft real-time fits the system description if the data no longer holds any interest when cut short.\\
This leaves us with the last option, firm real-time, which do fit the system. It is okay if payloads are aborted as none of the are  critical in order for the system to continue operating, but the value added by starting them are lost when they are aborted.
