\section{Reading the Input} \label{sec:read_input}
In order to model the payloads and environment, we will need some information from the user. The payloads are described through a CSV file where the dimensions represents the variables we will consider when producing the schedule. The environment, the satellites properties, and the robustness parameters are all described in a configuration file.\\
We have filled out both files to provide examples of how to use them. It is expected that the user changes all of the variables to represent their system.

\subsection{CSV File} \label{subsec:csv}
The payloads are defined by seven variables. An example of a CSV file with five payloads can be seen in \cref{lst:csv}. These are based on those from the GomX-3 nanosatellite\cite{gomx3}.\\
The \textbf{name} should indicate what the payload represents. When being modelled a payloads name will be translated into a number. The numeric name will also be used when it is referenced in the produced schedule. The first payload defined in the CSV file will be number zero and the n'th payload will be named n-1.\\
The \textbf{time} dimension specifies how much time, in minutes, it will take to complete the payload. It is defined by a range in order to allow for uncertainty in regards to the timing of the payloads\\
\textbf{Energy} specifies how high a load, in mAh, the payload applies on the battery every minute.\\
%The total load over the duration of one payload can therefore be calculated by multiplying energy with time.
\textbf{Profit} is expressed within a range from 1 to 5, which signifies how valuable or profitable it is to complete a payload.
1 being the least profitable and 5 being the most.
In this example, the first payload Slew represents the action of slewing the satellite. This does not directly generate any profit for the satellite as no data is gathered. L1 and L2 represents the use of the L-Band transmitter that the GomX-3 nanosatellite use to communicate with other satellites, which allows it to collect valuable data. Which is why it has been given a 5 in profit as it is the most profitable payload. The accumulated profit will be monitored when producing a schedule making it possible to filter out schedules that results in a lower total profit over its duration.\\
\textbf{Deadline} is either -1 or a positive integer and is used to cancel payloads which are delayed.
The scheduler may chose to wait before executing a payload and we can therefore risk that it is no longer relevant to execute the next payload in the queue.
The decision for whether or not to cancel a payload in regards to its deadline goes as follows: \textit{if the time we have spent waiting for the next payload to start plus the time it takes to complete the payload, exceeds the deadline; cancel}.\\
%waited\_time + execute\_time > Deadline \longrightarrow cancel\\
The -1 value means that there is no deadline.\\
\textbf{Dependencies} contains a list of other payloads which the current payload is waiting for to be completed. A payload may only be run if all payloads expressed in its dependencies have previously been activated. The user may type a $|$ which means logic "or" or the can type $\&$ which means logic "and".\\
%The user can set parentheses to
Some payloads can only be executed in certain time \textbf{widows}, such as when they are above the communication station on earth.
This is why we have added the Window dimension which restricts when the payload can be executed as it may only happen within the window. The window must occour between minimum time zero and maximum orbit time.
-1 disables the window.

UHF,	15-15,	15,		1,		-1,			-1,			45-60
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Configuration File} \label{subsec:init}
An example of the configuration file can be seen in \cref{lst:ini} where we have chosen to use the INI file standard. The configuration file is divided into three regions System, Cora, and SMC.\\
The System specific variables describes the satellite and the time constraints. Some of these parameters are explained in the following\\
The \textbf{schedule\_length} defines how long the produced schedule should be, in minutes.
We do not expect that the user defines every single operation that the satellite is capable of performing, which is why we have made an abstraction by introducing the \textbf{idle\_cost} variable. 
\textbf{idle\_cost} is the load that is imposes on the battery at all times, even when the satellite is idling, not currently executing any of the defined payloads.
This will allow us to disregard some of the payloads that the satellite may perform as they can be grouped together as one single background process which is always being executed.
The user should only consider payloads which can be executed in parallel to the defined payloads and only chose those which energy and time cost are trivial.
Failing to do so may result in a non representative model of their satellite and therefore a schedule where our guarantees may not be valid.\\
Based on the GOMX-3 article\cite{gomx3} we have decided to include the \textbf{safe\_threshold} variable.
This variable is used to determine when the satellite's SOC is too low to continue executing the schedule.
If the satellite go below this threshold, it is in danger of depleting the battery, which means it will not be able to communicate with the earth for a period of time.
This will result in a huge loss of potential profit as we are no longer able to execute profitable payloads and should therefore be avoided.
It is critical that the schedules we produce will never go below this threshold.\\
We have four variables that are related to the \gls{smc} model where three of them is used in its battery model.
\textbf{rec\_rate} defines the recharge rate when the satellite goes trough insolation, such that the value is added to the battery's capacity every minute.
\textbf{f\_rate} is a rate that is specific to the battery model we have chosen, and it is used to simulate the recovery effect of batteries.
The recovery effect will be described later in \cref{sec:kibam} \nameref{sec:kibam}.

At this point the \gls{cora} section does not contain any variables, the section is used as a placeholder for future versions of the file, as the model could be expanded to include variables specific to \gls{cora}. This will be touched upon in the \cref{sec:future} \nameref{sec:future}.
% as all of the lines beneath it is comments.
%Those are both variables that we want to add in the future, but we have not deemed absolutely necessary for our model.



Now that we know what kind of payloads that the satellite is capable of performing and we know about the environment it is in, we are able to start modelling the system.
