\section{UPPAAL CORA}
UPPAAL \gls{cora} is a version of UPPAAL which uses priced timed automata \cite{cs_cora}. \Gls{cora} have previously been used to find cost-optimal solutions for the GomX-3 system\cite{gomx3}, and is therefore considered relevant for this project.
\Gls{cora} is one of the older systems in the UPPAAL family, as this is the case it has curtain limitations not encountered in newer versions, such as the usage of floats. 
\Gls{cora} introduced the concept of cost, this means that when a certain locations in reached, it may have some specified cost, this however is limited to be linear. \\
This can be advantageous for modelling systems such as satellites where energy is an important and limited resource which can be represented by the cost. After running a query it is possible to extract a trace, which can be used to represent the generated schedule.
