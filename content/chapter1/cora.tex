\section{UPPAAL CORA}
UPPAAL \acrfull{cora} is a branch of UPPAAL, that uses linearly priced timed automata to find optimal paths satisfying certian goals, based on lowest accumulated cost\cite{cs_cora}. Cost is a variable that can be only be interacted with through locations, where it is possible to define the incremental rate it will grove with passing of time. It allows \gls{cora} to prune traces, if two traces reache the same location where all variables for each of the traces are identical expect for the cost variable, the trace with the lowest variable will be keept to preserve memory. Due to the underlying structure of \gls{cora} it is only possible to do simple reachabiity checks, and does not allow for liveness or deadlock checks. only best first search is support when using cost and cost is not allow to be used in an expression. Lastly \gls{cora} can't guarantee termination unless the modelled system is acyclic and clocks are bound by invariants.

\Gls{cora} have been used in a range of problems regarding scheduling problems, the most related case for our problem is GomX-3 case, where they used \gls{cora} to generate a battery aware schedule for CubeSat satellite. Their solution takes a set of parameters and generate fractions of the entire schedules and, when all parts of the schedules is generated, they are put together and tested with a \gls{kibam} battery model. This closely relate to our problem which makes \gls{cora} relevant for this project.

%This can be advantageous for modelling systems such as satellites where energy is an important and limited resource which can be represented by the cost. After running a query it is possible to extract a trace, which can be used to represent the generated schedule.

%optimal sceduling and planning.
%state-space exploration -> promising and cheap visited first -> prune parts of search tree not improving solution.
%symbolic data structure -> symbolic state-space representation with cost information -> optimal or near-optimal solutions

%S2,3: problem of cost-optimal reachability -> symbolic branch-and-bound solving this problem.
% clocks are non-negative real values, can be reset and grow at a fixed rate.

%S5: PTA-related optimization problems -> future support
