\chapter{Producing a schedule} \label{cha:analysis}
In this chapter we will describe the process of making a system capable of constructing a schedule for nanosatellites. We will define and describe an input-language, construct a model capable of creating said model, and explain relevant theory for creating such system.

We have chosen to use the GomX-3 nanosatellite as context for this project. The context will help us to make decisions in regards to how we solve the problems we will be facing, and help us make examples throughout the report. The nanosatellite have been described in \textbf{Bisgaard et al. 2016}\cite{gomx3} and we have modelled our payloads and other aspects based on this.
