\section{Solution} \label{sec:solution}
The solution we propose to the problem statement is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Input a configuration that specifies all of the payloads, battery properties, schedule properties, and validation options
	\item	Produce a \gls{cora} model that will find a optimal schedule
	\item	Validate the schedule in \gls{smc} to test the robustness and act accordingly to the result
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Rejected: modify the configuration and produce a new schedule for validation
		\item	Accepted: output schedule along with robustness results
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

By doing so we are able to produce a optimal schedule that is verified in regards to the robustness.
It is optimal in regards to profit while upholding the requirements, such as minimum acceptable battery level.
How the schedule is produced and how the robustness is tested will be explained at a later point.
