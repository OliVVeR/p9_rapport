\section{Solution} \label{sec:solution}
The solution we propose to the problem statement, introduced in the introduction, is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Input a configuration that specifies all of the payloads, environment, and validation options
	\item	Produce a \gls{cora} model that will find the a optimal schedule
	\item	Validate the schedule in \gls{smc} to test the robustness and act accordingly to the result
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Rejected: modify the configuration and produce a new schedule for validation
		\item	Accepted: output schedule along with robustness results
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

By doing so we are able to produce a optimal schedule that is verified in regards to the robustness.
It is optimal in regards to profit while upholding certain restrictions, such as minimum acceptable battery level.
How the schedule is generated and how the robustness is tested will be explained at a later point.
