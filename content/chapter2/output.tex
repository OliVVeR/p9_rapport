\section{Final Output}\label{sec:final}
The system will output two versions of the schedule and a result file that displays the robustness analysis. The raw schedule format is produced as a the result from UPPAAL \gls{cora} when we ask it to find the best trace for the chosen schedule duration. The other version of the schedule is one that have been transformed into a Gantt chart for better readability. The robustness analysis results is created by using UPPAAL \gls{smc}'s query feature in order to verify different properties of the schedule and model.

We will not discuss the raw version of the schedule, but a snippet of an example schedule can be found in \cref{cp:raw_example} \nameref{cp:raw_example}.
