\subsection{Gantt Chart}
A gantt chart is generated based on the \gls{cora} trace, an example of this can be seen in \jfx{cref til gantt chart billede}. From the gantt chart the user will be able to see when the individual payloads will be executed additionally the insolation and windows that specific task are allowed to run in is shown in the gantt chart to help the user get a better picture of the schedule and how the payloads are executed accordingly to their respective windows. On the right information about the different colors are shown, they represent the payloads, insolation, and windows. 

Since the \gls{cora} model only has a basic battery model this is not included, because it may give miss leading information to the user, likewise the \gls{smc} model is not one-to-one representation of the \gls{cora} schedule due to its different in execution lengths it will also not be a good representation of the battery levels during the schedule if their are compared to the cora schedule.
